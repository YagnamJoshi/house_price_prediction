# House Price Prediction

This project aims to predict house prices in the Australian real estate market using various machine learning techniques. The prediction model is designed to help a US-based housing company, Surprise Housing, strategically enter new markets, maximize revenue, and optimize investment decisions.

## Project Overview

The real estate market is complex and influenced by numerous factors. Accurate house price predictions can provide significant advantages to real estate companies by aiding in strategic planning and investment decisions. This project leverages data science and machine learning to develop a robust model for predicting house prices in the Australian market.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various features related to houses in Australia, such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and other relevant attributes. The dataset is not included in this repository due to privacy concerns.

Feature Engineering
Feature engineering is a critical step in this project. Key steps include:

Handling missing values
Encoding categorical variables
Scaling numerical features
Creating new features from existing ones
Model Training
Several machine learning models were evaluated to find the best-performing model. The process includes:

Splitting the data into training and testing sets
Training various models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search and Random Search
Evaluation
The models were evaluated using metrics such as:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R-squared (R²)
Results
The final model achieved the following performance metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 25,000 AUD
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 1,200,000,000 AUD²
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 34,641 AUD
R-squared (R²): 0.85
Usage
To use the model for predictions, run the following script:

python predict.py --input data/new_houses.csv --output predictions.csv
